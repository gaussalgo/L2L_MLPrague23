    "## 3.💡Specific tasks\n",
    "As stated above Transformers can be used in multiple ways, depending on what the desired output is. We can either use the whole architecture as shown above or use only the decoder or the encoder. In every task the input is sequence of tokens. The output and how we aquire it depends on which task we choose. However we are able to sort them into two categories: **Token classification** and **Text generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Token classification\n",
    "For these tasks we need to have the best representation for each word within its context(left and right). Model pretrained on tasks such as MLM are best suited for token classification. For the classification itself, we want the best representation of the input sequence and therefore we use the last hidden state of the encoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text classification (positive/negative)**: Before the sequence we wish to classify we add a $[CLS]$ token. After recieving the hidden states,we process them through a linear layer and based on the value for the $[CLS]$ token we classify the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Token classification (NER)**: Linear layer processes the hidden states to logits, where cross-entropy loss is computed, to return a most probable label for each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extractive QA**: Linear layer processes the hidden states to logits, where cross-entropy loss is computed, to find the best candidates for start and end of the answer tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Text generation\n",
    "With these tasks the end goal is to guess the most probable token following the previous tokens. Model pre-trained on tasks similar to CLM are best suitable for text generation task. The following tasks have a certain overlap, as they both have text as input and output. These tasks need next token generation, which is provided by the decoder and as such can be performed by either a traditional Encoder-Decoder or Decoder-only Transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases the embeddings are processed (either through a ED or D transformer) and the decoder hidden states are processed by a linear layer and we get logits from which we determine the most probable token.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text generation (Completion, code generation): Given a sequence of words, the model generates the next word. This task can be trained on unlabeled data and is often used with Decoder-only transformers. \n",
    "* Sequence to sequence (Summarization, Translation, etc.): These tasks need the model to learn to map pairs of text (english to german, article to abstract). These tasks are mainly about transcribing the input into a different text (translate to a different language / simplify the text but maintain the meaning) and benefit from understanding the input sequence.

    "### 3.3 Decoder or Encoder-Decoder?\n",
    "With the rise of ChatGPT and seing its capabilities it is a valid question if a GPT (Decoder only) model would not suffice even on tasks, previously though better suited for a seq2seq task. A [Paper comparing Encoder-Decoder and Decoder-only models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04052.pdf) on machine translation showed some reasons, why we shouldn't focus only on decoder-only large language models for all text generation tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for using Decoder-only models:\n",
    "* Smaller size and can be trained on much more data (unsupervised)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons against using Decoder-only models:\n",
    "* No encoder hidden states in the decoder self-attention layers\n",
    "* The only information about the input sequence is in the decoder hidden states\n",
    "This results in more hallucination with the growing index of generation and the attention degeneration, as the hidden states cannot hold information about the input sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The best rule-of-thunb would be: If you need the model to not diverge from initial input -> Encoder-Decoder. Would you greatly benefit from exposing the model to a large quantity of data and diverging from the input sequence meaning is not a massive drawback for you -> Decoder-only"
